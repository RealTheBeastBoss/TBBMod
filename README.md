Hello, this repository will tell you the code that went into my mod

# Downloading the Mod

The zip folder contains a .jar file. This goes in the forge mod folder.
It also holds a folder which needs to go in your resource pack folder if you choose to play with Optifine (recommended)
Make sure you activate the resource pack in-game
